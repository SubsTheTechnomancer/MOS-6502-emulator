# MOS 6502 emulator
This project emulates the MOS 6502 CPU using various languages.
 
Specifically, the emulation is of a variation of the MOS 6502 CPU, called the
Ricoh 2A03 (RP2A03), most significantly used in the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) due to the prescense of an audio processing unit (APU) on the chip.

Most of the code concepts and research is derived from Dudley, Rory. "MOS Technology 6502 CPU Emulation." (2020).

Currently, the planned languages to implement the CPU are:-
 * Python (Possibly slow)
 * C++
